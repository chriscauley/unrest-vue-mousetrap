## Welcome!

When you press a hotkey, the lines in the source code are highlighted.
The left column tells how many times that line has been triggered.

While this welcome message is open, all hotkeys other than `enter`
are disabled.

Press `enter` again and then scroll down to see more hotkey examples.
