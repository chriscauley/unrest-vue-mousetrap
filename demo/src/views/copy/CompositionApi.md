## Welcome!

When you press a hotkey, the lines in the source code are highlighted.
The left column tells how many times that line has been triggered.

While this welcome message is open, all hotkeys other than `enter` are disabled.

Note: In this example the first argument of `Mousetrap.use` is a function.
This means the hotkeys are rebound any time `data.show_welcome` changes (since
it is a reactive property accesed during the function call).

Press `enter` again and then scroll down to see more hotkey examples.
